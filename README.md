# parallel_coordinate_plot

A Python package for producing parallel coordinate plots.


## Rationale

Parallel coordinate plots are sometimes preferred over traditional radar (or spider) plots. In radar plots, its internal area is typically viewed as a visual metric to qualify the performance, but the shape and area are highly dependent on the order of data dimensions around the circle.

Parallel coordinate plots avoid this issue, and only visualize the relevant information --- groupings in each dimension.
